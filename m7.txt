Psuedocode: Get the Cheesy Puffs
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/444195870/
What are the rules?
    Use the cat sprite to chase the cheesy puff sprite
    Catch the cheesy puff sprite with the cat sprite 10x and you win
How does this translate into code?
    Use the left, right, up and down arrow to move the cat sprite
    The cheesy puff sprite will move randomly
    When the cat sprite and the cheesy puff sprite cross, there will be a moew sound and the score variable will increase by 1 point
    When the score variable reaches 10 the cat sprite will show a text box that says "Winner!" for 2 seconds and all motion on screen will stop.
Will you need loops? If/else statements?
    I will need two if/then statments and one loop for the cat sprite
What variables?
    Cat    
    Mouse
    score
Under what circumstances do the variables change?
    when the cat sprite and cheesy puff sprite cross the score variable will increase by 1 point.

Psuedocode: Scratch That Cat
What are the rulse?
    Mouse A falls from random location every x secs
    Mouse B falls from random location every x secs
    Mouse C falls from random location every x secs
    Mouse D falls from random location every x secs
        overlap more as player levels up
    Shoot ## of mice with projectile in x amount of time to lvl up
    Miss ## of mice lose ## amount of life
        if lose ## amount of life game over
    Shoot mice before reach bottom, if mouse reaches bottom sub from life
    Life increases with lvl
    L R keyes to move L R
    Spacebar to shoot
    if player shoots mouse, mouse is deleted, player gets 1 pt

How does this translate into code?
    score = ## of mice hit with projectile, set at 0
    level = increase in difficulty, more mice less time, set at 0
    life = ## of misses allowed per lvl, lvl 1 = 3 ; lvl 2 = 4 ; lvl 3 = 5...

Will you need loops? If/else statements?
    Is the sprite R? T/F
    Is the sprite L? T/F
    Is it time for Mouse A,B,C,D to fall? T/F 
    Has player missed ## of mice? T/F -> game over
    Has player shot ## of mice? T/F -> lvl up

What variables?
    mouse
    time
    score
    lvl
    life
    sprite
    porjectile
    mouse & porjectile/time = game over

Under what circumstances do the variables change?
    variable change when level up happens?
         more mice per time = more lives
